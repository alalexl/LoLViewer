# Summary

**IMPORTANT**
New Champions, reworked champions or new skins won't work due to an outdated importer and new code of riot. I was able to get all champions up to Velkoz so everything up to the release of velkoz should work.

Please visit:  http://lol3dmodels.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=0 for new and other champions. I will try to upload them later as well.

*EDIT* 
Due to my master I might not have that much time to help you guys, I'm sorry.

Poro Rider sejuani was not in my archive so I tried to remix sejuani skins to make my own: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:674515  

Yet, I didn't try to print these myself. If you have to much trouble printing it please let me know.  


Ask me if you want:   
-Skins Models and texture files  
-Armature    
-Monsters  
-Complete folder   

I'll try to upload it asap

# Print Settings

Printer: FlashForge Dreamer
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.3mm
Infill: 30%

Notes: 
everything depends on the size you want and the model you choose to print. I didn't print them all, so please let me know how it went and which settings you used.

# How I Designed This

Using RAF manager I could extract the files from the champions and such. I used plugin for an older version of blender to import/export the files to make it printable. So these models are just the game models. They were never designed to be printed, flaws may be detected. Please let me know if you have troubles, then I will try to fix it, or if you fixed some errors yourselves, please send me the better version in order to keep this up to date.

# Instructions

I did not print all the models yet but I'll let you know my experience when I go print these.   
Please let me know you're experience about the models to improve the models and printing settings  


Update:  
I printed Kennen on my flash Forge dreamer   
I used:  
- meshmixer to create my support or my slicer   
- Blue PLA  
- Nozzle Temp. 200 C  
- Bed Temp. 30 C  

I printed him a little to small. So one foot was cut off, oops. I thought it was a piece of the supporting material.  

I use Slic3r or Skeinforge as slicers   

Update i've got my PVA (soluble in water) which makes printing way easier.
